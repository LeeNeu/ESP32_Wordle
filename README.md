# ESP32_Wordle 

## Why I started this
I started this project in my Mechatronics-Introductary course at University. It is by far not complete nor is the code very good. 
It should be seen as a foundation you can build on and improve your learning in C++ and ESP projects.
So feel free to fork this code and experiment with it.

## What does it do?
This project is a Wordle game which runs on an ESP-32 (ESP-8266 works as well see below). The output gets displayed on a LCD Display and the input device is a joystick.

## What do you need to get started
### Hardware
- ESP32 or ESP8266
- LCD Display with an I2C interface
- Arduino Joystick or similiar
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
**Please note you do not need to have the Hardware to start programming. You just need it for proper testing and running of the project.**

## Software
- Visual Studio Code with Platform.io installed. 
(If you don't know what I am talking about just have a look on YouTube. 
There are plenty of resources on how to install and use this setup and also it is the Standard of ESP programming)
